 UART Transmitter–Receiver System (Verilog + GDSII)
 Overview

This project implements a fully functional UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver–Transmitter) system in Verilog HDL, including baud rate generation, transmission, and reception modules.
The design has been verified at the RTL level and successfully synthesized, placed, and routed using OpenLane, generating a final GDSII layout suitable for ASIC fabrication.

Key Features

Complete UART protocol implementation (TX + RX + Baud generator)

Compatible with 8-bit serial communication

Modular top-level design with reusable submodules

Synchronous, synthesizable RTL code

Designed for hardware realization (ASIC flow)

GDSII layout generated and verified using open-source VLSI tools

1	Stop Bit	Always 1
Operation Flow

TX: On tx_wr_enb, 8-bit parallel data is serialized and transmitted bit-by-bit.

RX: Incoming serial data is sampled using rx_enb, converted into parallel form, and output with rx_rdy high.

Baud Rate: Generated by dividing the system clock into TX and RX enable pulses.

 Baud Rate Generator

TX Enable (tx_enb) triggers every 5208 cycles (for ~9600 baud at 50 MHz).

RX Enable (rx_enb) triggers every 325 cycles, providing mid-bit sampling stability.

Both are fully synchronous counters reset on system reset.

 State Machine Design
Transmitter FSM
State	Description
S_IDLE	Wait for wr_enb signal
S_START	Send start bit (0)
S_DATA	Send 8 data bits (LSB first)
S_STOP	Send stop bit (1)
Receiver FSM
State	Description
IDLE	Wait for start bit detection
START	Validate start bit
DATA	Receive 8 bits serially
STOP	Validate stop bit
DONE	Set rdy high and output data
 Simulation

Run and verify the UART behavior using the following commands:

# Compile all modules
iverilog -o uart_sim uart_top.v

# Run simulation
vvp uart_sim

# Open waveform viewer
gtkwave uart.vcd


You can test different baud rates or input data sequences by modifying the testbench.
